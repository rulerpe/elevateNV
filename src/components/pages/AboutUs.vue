          <p>2018 got off to a rather inauspicious start for the cannabis industry when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo on January 4. The role of the Cole memo was to afford certain protections to the cannabis industry in states that have legalized marijuana. You can read about both its origins and potential impact on cannabis access in &ldquo;Cole Memo Confusion&rdquo; penned by local attorney Derek Connors on page 32.</p>
<p>I bring this up because although Sessions is intent on bringing a chill to the industry and hinder access to cannabis, there is a federal lawsuit which could change that. On February 14, Manhattan Federal Judge Alvin Hellerstein heard arguments for a July 2017 lawsuit in which several medical marijuana users sued the federal government for access to cannabis.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has a variety of plaintiffs that include Alexis Bortell, a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy, who successfully uses whole-plant cannabis to treat her seizures, and seven-year-old Jagger Cotte, who has Leigh's Disease and has been able to prolong his life by more than two years by using THC-concentrated medical marijuana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heart of the plaintiffs&rsquo; case is the claim that the federal ban on cannabis violates the U.S. Constitution. Under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it is considered to have a high potential for abuse and no medical use. The plaintiffs&rsquo; lead attorney Michael Hiller made short order of cannabis&rsquo; lack of medical value by introducing the medical conditions of his clients. Hiller made such a convincing case that Judge Hellerstein commented on it during the hearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your clients are living proof of the medical applications of marijuana,&rdquo; Hellerstein said. &ldquo;I have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true. How could anyone say that your clients&rsquo; lives have not been saved by marijuana? How can anyone say that your clients&rsquo; pain and suffering has not been alleviated by marijuana? You can&rsquo;t, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Judge Hellerstein didn&rsquo;t doubt medical marijuana&rsquo;s potential, he had reservations about whether the lawsuit could proceed on legal grounds. He concluded that he will have to consider whether he has the power to change cannabis&rsquo; Schedule I status and that plaintiffs may have to pursue Schedule I changes through the appropriate government agency, which is the Drug Enforcement Agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this case is being decided, one point that should not be overlooked comes in the form of U.S. Patent No. 6,630,507, which Hiller cited to reporters following the hearing. Granted in 2003 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the patent covers the potential use of non-psychoactive cannabinoids to protect the brain from damage or degeneration caused by certain diseases, such as cirrhosis. In the case of No. 6,630,507, National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers discovered that non-psychoactive compounds in cannabis may have antioxidant properties that could be beneficial in the treatment of certain neurological diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an astounding piece of hypocrisy, but as Dean Bortell, Alexis&rsquo; father, told <em>Forbes</em> after the hearing: &ldquo;Kids are growing up seeing this hypocrisy...But we're going to get it done.&rdquo;</p>

          <p class="headline text-xs-center"><i>Educate with a more informed understanding of the benefits of medicinal cannabis</i></p>
          <p>
            When we decided to start Elevate Nevada it was a result of a wholehearted belief that an instrumental component of the medicinal cannabis debate was missing from the overall discussion. The stigma of cannabis was preventing people, who are/were suffering with major diseases or general illness, from learning about and trying marijuana alternatives that would aid in healing their bodies in an all-natural way.</p><p>
            We believed the market was missing a forum for discovering the positive aspects of medicinal cannabis. We wanted to create this publication to better educate the community about medicinal marijuana as another option to combat pain and illness — specifically an option that is all-natural and removes the toxicity of pharmaceuticals from the equation. In today’s world, doctors prescribe medicinal cannabis as a treatment for everything from sleeping disorders, aches and pains to PTSD and the effects of medical treatments such as chemotherapy.</p><p>
            With Elevate Nevada we endeavor to create a resource that presents the educational aspects of medicinal cannabis — a subject that is rapidly gaining interest in Nevada. This interest stems from the fact that as of this year, state law allows for legal dispensaries as well as the cultivation and testing of cannabis for treating medical conditions.</p><p>
            Our motivation to start Elevate Nevada also came from personal experience. Several of the Elevate team had family members who suffered from diseases and could have experienced great relief if medicinal cannabis had been legal and available to them. When you care about someone and are watching them suffer, every option is on the table and so we wanted to create a forum for people to investigate the option of medicinal cannabis and make informed decisions for the sake of their loved ones.</p><p>
            We hope you leave this site educated and with a more informed understanding of the benefits of medicinal cannabis.

          Socrates so sagely said: “The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but building the new.” </p><p>
          Change is here and I honestly never thought I would see cannabis, marijuana, dope, weed, pot, grass or whatever you like to call it become legal in my lifetime.  But here we are Nevada–breaking ground and building the new. </p><p>
          For the people who are still on the fence or on the other side of the fence about the legalization of cannabis, this is your chance to understand, educate yourself, explore and learn the powers of the healing properties of this plant. Even though we use verbiage like recreational and adult-use, cannabis is still preventative medicine. Just in the last few weeks I have experienced its medicinal benefits.   </p><p>
          In my recent travels around the state getting to know people in the industry, I was lucky enough to meet Marina and Jackie from CBD for Life, which is a line of cannabidiol (CBD) infused pain management and beauty products. elevate editor Beth Schwartz swears by CBD for Life products, remember the line from our January 2016 cover? Beth was so delighted with the results of CBD her enthusiasm resulted in the headline: “Forget smoking cannabis, we should be smearing it all over our bodies.” It was my turn to try the wonders of CBD topicals and golly gee whiz Beth was onto something. (Editor’s note: Just shaking my head over here.) </p><p>
          I decided to try it for an issue that has plagued me my whole life from when I was 13 years old and chunks of my scalp were falling out. Kids were making fun of me and teasing me that I had lice. I didn’t have lice, it was the beginning of a lifelong battle with psoriasis, which is on several areas of my body including my elbows and hands. </p><p>
          Until recently people would ask me why I had white paint on my elbows, that’s how severe psoriasis affects me. I was telling Jackie about my psoriasis and how it makes me feel a little insecure, and because I had tried everything I was doubtful anything, including CBD, would work. Jackie instructed me to loofah my problem areas and use CBD for Life’s face and body cleanser and lotion several times a day. She was right! My psoriasis looks better than it ever has–well, there’s really not much to see anymore just fresh pink skin. CBD doesn’t cure it, but you cannot see the flaky white skin, or traces of psoriasis on my hands or elbows right now. </p><p>
          Because it was such a transformative experience for me, I just sent my dad some Pure CBD for Life Rub for his arthritis, and he reported back, after being doubtful, that it is indeed helping. So, whatever your feelings are on Nevada’s laws and the legalization of cannabis, keep an open mind. Stop fighting the old and focus on the new because, and I hope you don’t, someday you or someone you love may need the healing benefits of cannabis. </p><p>
          Salute, Guy</p>
