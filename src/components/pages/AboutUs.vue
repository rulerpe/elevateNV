          <p>I hail from a family of farmers. Hale, hearty and hardworking people who have grown soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, and corn on 65 acres in Dayton, Ohio, just north of Greater Cincinnati, since 1941. My grandparents bought the land that Shady Knoll farm sat on when my mother was three months old. They farmed the land and then my uncle took over and he farmed it until last year. Big business had moved in over the last few years, surrounding the farm and due to engineering issues caused by new corporate infrastructure, it became impractical to continue and Shady Knoll was sold—taking with it both a family’s home of 77 years as well as their livelihood.</p>
          <p>Because of my family’s origins in farming, I have always kept an eye on related issues, especially the Farm Bills that are passed by Congress every five years to update policy and legislation related to agriculture, the farm industry, and food production. </p>
          <p>So, of course, it was with much interest that I followed the most recent Farm Bill, or Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, as it snaked its way through various committees and legislative bodies before making its way to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law on December 20th. It turned out to be quite </p>
          <p>a Christmas present to the farming industry as the federal deregulation of hemp legalized interstate commerce and provided access to banking, federal water rights, and crop insurance.</p>
          <p>Hemp has the potential to be a huge boon to farmers across America—with hemp plants now being grown in at least 19 states, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. Because industrial hemp-based goods include everything from fiber, paper, plastic, and batteries to building materials, food and beauty products, hemp’s growing value has been quickly gaining ground. In its 2017 U.S. Hemp Crop Report, Vote Hemp, a national hemp advocacy group, reported that 23,343 acres of hemp were cultivated in the U.S. and that figure more than doubled to 77,000 acres in 2018. </p>
          <p>“The amount of uses for hemp are limitless. In 15 years’ time, hemp will make up at least 85 percent of the products in your home, from food to building materials to paper…Products are going to make a splash when created and are going to bring a lot of jobs to America. It will bring a lot of manufacturing jobs into the country as well as farming jobs,” stated Eric Wang, CEO of Ananda Hemp, to Remedy Review. </p>
          <p>“It cannot be overstated how beneficial this plant could be for U.S. farmers in the coming years,” Forbes pointed out in a December 20th article. “As the agricultural landscape of America evolves—creating challenges for farmers ranging from flagging industries like tobacco and dairy to climate change and the ongoing Chinese tariff situation affecting soybean sales—a more sustainable domestic crop is essential.”</p>
          <p>Remedy Review concurred, pointing out in a February 15th article that “total U.S. sales of hemp products have climbed sharply, soaring to $820 million in 2017. With sales projected to top the billion-dollar mark in 2018, the retail market for domestic hemp looks poised for continued growth. With some estimates projecting that domestic sales of CBD products alone will surpass $2 billion in just the next two years, the commercialization of the American hemp industry might be arriving at the best possible time.”</p>
          <p>Making it the saving grace of the American farmer before we lose anymore. </p>

          <p class="headline text-xs-center"><i>Educate with a more informed understanding of the benefits of medicinal cannabis</i></p>
          <p>
            When we decided to start Elevate Nevada it was a result of a wholehearted belief that an instrumental component of the medicinal cannabis debate was missing from the overall discussion. The stigma of cannabis was preventing people, who are/were suffering with major diseases or general illness, from learning about and trying marijuana alternatives that would aid in healing their bodies in an all-natural way.</p><p>
            We believed the market was missing a forum for discovering the positive aspects of medicinal cannabis. We wanted to create this publication to better educate the community about medicinal marijuana as another option to combat pain and illness — specifically an option that is all-natural and removes the toxicity of pharmaceuticals from the equation. In today’s world, doctors prescribe medicinal cannabis as a treatment for everything from sleeping disorders, aches and pains to PTSD and the effects of medical treatments such as chemotherapy.</p><p>
            With Elevate Nevada we endeavor to create a resource that presents the educational aspects of medicinal cannabis — a subject that is rapidly gaining interest in Nevada. This interest stems from the fact that as of this year, state law allows for legal dispensaries as well as the cultivation and testing of cannabis for treating medical conditions.</p><p>
            Our motivation to start Elevate Nevada also came from personal experience. Several of the Elevate team had family members who suffered from diseases and could have experienced great relief if medicinal cannabis had been legal and available to them. When you care about someone and are watching them suffer, every option is on the table and so we wanted to create a forum for people to investigate the option of medicinal cannabis and make informed decisions for the sake of their loved ones.</p><p>
            We hope you leave this site educated and with a more informed understanding of the benefits of medicinal cannabis.

          <p>
          Socrates so sagely said: “The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but building the new.” </p><p>
          Change is here and I honestly never thought I would see cannabis, marijuana, dope, weed, pot, grass or whatever you like to call it become legal in my lifetime.  But here we are Nevada–breaking ground and building the new. </p><p>
          For the people who are still on the fence or on the other side of the fence about the legalization of cannabis, this is your chance to understand, educate yourself, explore and learn the powers of the healing properties of this plant. Even though we use verbiage like recreational and adult-use, cannabis is still preventative medicine. Just in the last few weeks I have experienced its medicinal benefits.   </p><p>
          In my recent travels around the state getting to know people in the industry, I was lucky enough to meet Marina and Jackie from CBD for Life, which is a line of cannabidiol (CBD) infused pain management and beauty products. elevate editor Beth Schwartz swears by CBD for Life products, remember the line from our January 2016 cover? Beth was so delighted with the results of CBD her enthusiasm resulted in the headline: “Forget smoking cannabis, we should be smearing it all over our bodies.” It was my turn to try the wonders of CBD topicals and golly gee whiz Beth was onto something. (Editor’s note: Just shaking my head over here.) </p><p>
          I decided to try it for an issue that has plagued me my whole life from when I was 13 years old and chunks of my scalp were falling out. Kids were making fun of me and teasing me that I had lice. I didn’t have lice, it was the beginning of a lifelong battle with psoriasis, which is on several areas of my body including my elbows and hands. </p><p>
          Until recently people would ask me why I had white paint on my elbows, that’s how severe psoriasis affects me. I was telling Jackie about my psoriasis and how it makes me feel a little insecure, and because I had tried everything I was doubtful anything, including CBD, would work. Jackie instructed me to loofah my problem areas and use CBD for Life’s face and body cleanser and lotion several times a day. She was right! My psoriasis looks better than it ever has–well, there’s really not much to see anymore just fresh pink skin. CBD doesn’t cure it, but you cannot see the flaky white skin, or traces of psoriasis on my hands or elbows right now. </p><p>
          Because it was such a transformative experience for me, I just sent my dad some Pure CBD for Life Rub for his arthritis, and he reported back, after being doubtful, that it is indeed helping. So, whatever your feelings are on Nevada’s laws and the legalization of cannabis, keep an open mind. Stop fighting the old and focus on the new because, and I hope you don’t, someday you or someone you love may need the healing benefits of cannabis. </p><p>
          Salute, Guy</p>
