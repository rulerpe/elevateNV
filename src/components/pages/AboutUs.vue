          <p class="headline text-xs-center"><i>Educate with a more informed understanding of the benefits of medicinal cannabis</i></p>
          <p>
            When we decided to start Elevate Nevada it was a result of a wholehearted belief that an instrumental component of the medicinal cannabis debate was missing from the overall discussion. The stigma of cannabis was preventing people, who are/were suffering with major diseases or general illness, from learning about and trying marijuana alternatives that would aid in healing their bodies in an all-natural way.</p><p>
            We believed the market was missing a forum for discovering the positive aspects of medicinal cannabis. We wanted to create this publication to better educate the community about medicinal marijuana as another option to combat pain and illness — specifically an option that is all-natural and removes the toxicity of pharmaceuticals from the equation. In today’s world, doctors prescribe medicinal cannabis as a treatment for everything from sleeping disorders, aches and pains to PTSD and the effects of medical treatments such as chemotherapy.</p><p>
            With Elevate Nevada we endeavor to create a resource that presents the educational aspects of medicinal cannabis — a subject that is rapidly gaining interest in Nevada. This interest stems from the fact that as of this year, state law allows for legal dispensaries as well as the cultivation and testing of cannabis for treating medical conditions.</p><p>
            Our motivation to start Elevate Nevada also came from personal experience. Several of the Elevate team had family members who suffered from diseases and could have experienced great relief if medicinal cannabis had been legal and available to them. When you care about someone and are watching them suffer, every option is on the table and so we wanted to create a forum for people to investigate the option of medicinal cannabis and make informed decisions for the sake of their loved ones.</p><p>
            We hope you leave this site educated and with a more informed understanding of the benefits of medicinal cannabis.

          Socrates so sagely said: “The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but building the new.” </p><p>
          Change is here and I honestly never thought I would see cannabis, marijuana, dope, weed, pot, grass or whatever you like to call it become legal in my lifetime.  But here we are Nevada–breaking ground and building the new. </p><p>
          For the people who are still on the fence or on the other side of the fence about the legalization of cannabis, this is your chance to understand, educate yourself, explore and learn the powers of the healing properties of this plant. Even though we use verbiage like recreational and adult-use, cannabis is still preventative medicine. Just in the last few weeks I have experienced its medicinal benefits.   </p><p>
          In my recent travels around the state getting to know people in the industry, I was lucky enough to meet Marina and Jackie from CBD for Life, which is a line of cannabidiol (CBD) infused pain management and beauty products. elevate editor Beth Schwartz swears by CBD for Life products, remember the line from our January 2016 cover? Beth was so delighted with the results of CBD her enthusiasm resulted in the headline: “Forget smoking cannabis, we should be smearing it all over our bodies.” It was my turn to try the wonders of CBD topicals and golly gee whiz Beth was onto something. (Editor’s note: Just shaking my head over here.) </p><p>
          I decided to try it for an issue that has plagued me my whole life from when I was 13 years old and chunks of my scalp were falling out. Kids were making fun of me and teasing me that I had lice. I didn’t have lice, it was the beginning of a lifelong battle with psoriasis, which is on several areas of my body including my elbows and hands. </p><p>
          Until recently people would ask me why I had white paint on my elbows, that’s how severe psoriasis affects me. I was telling Jackie about my psoriasis and how it makes me feel a little insecure, and because I had tried everything I was doubtful anything, including CBD, would work. Jackie instructed me to loofah my problem areas and use CBD for Life’s face and body cleanser and lotion several times a day. She was right! My psoriasis looks better than it ever has–well, there’s really not much to see anymore just fresh pink skin. CBD doesn’t cure it, but you cannot see the flaky white skin, or traces of psoriasis on my hands or elbows right now. </p><p>
          Because it was such a transformative experience for me, I just sent my dad some Pure CBD for Life Rub for his arthritis, and he reported back, after being doubtful, that it is indeed helping. So, whatever your feelings are on Nevada’s laws and the legalization of cannabis, keep an open mind. Stop fighting the old and focus on the new because, and I hope you don’t, someday you or someone you love may need the healing benefits of cannabis. </p><p>
          Salute, Guy</p>

          The last year has passed in a whirl. It seems like it was just last week, not last year, that we were debating the pros and cons of Question #2 with our fellow residents and wondering if recreational marijuana would come to fruition. Fast forward a year later and not only did the voters of Nevada pass it by 54 percent, but in their typical can-do style, state officials figured out how to effectively and efficiently launch Nevada’s entire adult-use program in a harried timeline of a mere six months.</p><p>
          On July 1st Nevada became the first of the four states that voted recreational cannabis in during the November 2016 elections to get its adult-use program up and running. Massachusetts and Maine also approved recreational marijuana but are still working on regulatory logistics. California also said yes to recreational marijuana last year and is nipping at Nevada’s buds and probably some of the Silver State’s market share too. Not only will Californians be celebrating the flipping of the calendar to a new year on December 31, but peeps of the Golden State will also see recreational dispensaries open at the stroke of midnight. I am guessing that will be a legendary party of the most epic proportions since medical marijuana has been legal in California since 1996 and has some 500,000 patients that make for a solid base. Oh, and it’s California.</p><p>
          The cannabis landscape has changed dramatically in that the nearly 3 million residents of Nevada now have access to legal recreational cannabis as do the 42 million tourists who visit Las Vegas every year. It’s been fascinating to talk to people who aren’t in the industry. When I am out and about people I speak with still can’t believe that if they are over 21 they can walk freely into a dispensary and buy a pre-roll or jar of cannabis for a little Saturday night fun or even pick up a cannabis-based topical cream or salve for aches and pains. With more than 50 dispensaries in Nevada you should, at the very least, stop in and check one out. Or consider getting the cannabis lover in your life a holiday treat. elevate product reviewer Justin Alexander outlines some great gift-giving ideas on page 6 in his review “Making Your List and Checking It Twice.”</p><p>
          Although there have been largescale changes regarding cannabis use, in many ways it hasn’t changed that much at all. Even though residents and tourists can legally use cannabis, unless they are on private property, they have no place to partake in it. American Green recognized the trepidation of many state and county jurisdictions and decided to nip that in the bud, so to speak, and bought their own town. The publicly-traded cannabis company’s purchase of Nipton, a tiny town only 45 minutes from Las Vegas, located in San Bernardino County, California will prove yet another interesting experiment in the cannabis space. elevate visited the quaint little burg several times this fall so you could read all about enchanting Nipton in our story on page 17.</p><p>
          In closing, don’t get lost in the hustle and bustle of the season. Take a moment and revel in the precious memories and truly enjoy your loved ones. Peace be with you.</p><p>
          With an open mind,</p><p>
          Beth</p>
