As for the cannabis lover, there’s no end of choices from flower and pre-rolls to vape pens and concentrates. Just find out if they prefer an indica or sativa. If you aren’t sure, a hybrid is always a safe bet. To follow are some selections from the Nevada marketplace that will give you a general idea of what you will find as you begin your hunt for the perfect holiday gift.

              <h4 class="headline custom-headline mt-4 mb-2">Stacked Deck Limited Edition Pre-Rolls by Redwood</h4>
              <p class="subheading">
                For the classic smoker on your list, you will ace gift giving this year with Stacked Deck pre-rolls from Redwood. For those who love the simplicity of sparking one up, go all in with Redwood’s Stacked Deck pre-rolls, which come in packaging that resembles a deck of cards. Different strains are available as well as mix packs for a full house of flavor, so it comes as no surprise that this is a top gift item for cannabis lovers during holiday 2017. The novel and clever presentation will bring a smile to the receiver’s face before it is even cracked open. Once this premium bud is lit up, the good times continue to roll back to whatever era you fancy. If you are over 50 you will appreciate the humor and nostalgia, if you are younger, embrace the vintage, retro vibes of this unique offering.

              <h4 class="headline custom-headline mt-4 mb-2">Kynd Cannabis Company’s Peppermint Chocolate</h4>
              <p class="subheading">
                Like eggnog and gingerbread cookies, the taste of peppermint is a holiday staple. As is chocolate, which always makes a great gift especially when you add THC oil into the mix making for a happy ho-ho-ho holiday indeed. Kynd Peppermint Chocolates—a seasonal offering—come in a convenient dosing pack of four squares with 11.1mg THC per square. “We don’t doubt it’s going to take the market by storm,” says Kynd’s chief operating officer Stacy Castillo of this latest release, which is a product of Kynd’s collaboration with a local chocolatier that started in 2016. Dark chocolate in conjunction with crunchy peppermint candy combine for a taste that is as mellow as the relaxing high, but without couchlock. Kynd’s peppermint chocolates are so tasty it might be hard to eat just one, but remember to start slow as the effects come on gradually and last longer than smoking.

              <h4 class="headline custom-headline mt-4 mb-2">Kabunky Kreme</h4>
              <p class="subheading">
                Body creams make great stocking stuffers for everyone on your list since they have so many applications. Made with extracted cannabis lipids, it is best to only use small amounts of Kabunky Kreme during each application as it is high in THC unlike many of the CBD-rich creams on the market. Kabunky Kreme has 763mg of THC per bottle and 310mg of CBD. While Kabunky does not call out particular genetics that go into this delightfully effective elixir—the biproducts from various plants are used for healing to create a soothing effect. It has a wide array of uses and applications and is recommended for burns, cuts, muscle aches, back pain, arthritis and more, as well as for those who suffer from lower back pain.

              <h4 class="headline custom-headline mt-4 mb-2">Vert’s Red Velvet Cookie Square</h4>
              <p class="subheading">
                Designed to be gifted without wrapping because of its pleasing packaging, Vert wants to change the way people view cannabis-infused foods. “As a Las Vegas company, edible brand presentation and flavor are extremely important to us,” says Margaux Hansberry, Vert account executive. “Many people tend to shy away from edibles due to a negative experience they may have had from a home baked marijuana brownie back in the day. We set out to redefine that experience with a homogenized edible made for the consumer to both feed their mind and savor the flavor.”
              </p>
              <p class="subheading">
                Made with Chunky Diesel oil—Organa Labs certified triple refined oil with amazing taste and potency—the Red Velvet Cookie Square has 8mg of CBG, or cannabigerol, a non-intoxicating cannabinoid. “The genetic parents are Deep Chunk and Sour Diesel, which account for the high amount of CBG because the latter is the parent for several strains that characteristically help relieve temple pressure such as Headband and Sour Kush, also an effect of CBG,” Hansberry says, who notes the presence of CBG is good for Glaucoma sufferers as it decreases ocular pressure.
              </p>
              <p class="subheading">
                If you’ve got someone on your list who could use a good night’s sleep, the Red Velvet Cookie Square will delight insomniacs. It is also perfect for those who love this trendy holiday flavor. Chef Melissa Parks, who creates all the recipes, is an expert at masking any cannabis taste. “Melissa has taken into account every variable that could potentially affect cannabinoid/terpene burnoff rates and consistent dosages in our products,” Hansberry says.

              <h4 class="headline custom-headline mt-4 mb-2">Cannabiotix’s Mandarin Mint flower</h4>
              <p class="subheading">
                While edibles make a merry addition to a gift basket during the holidays, don’t underestimate the happiness a jar of premium flower can also bring at this time of year. Guaranteed you will be on the top of everyone’s party invite list when it gets around that you are gifting strains of Cannabiotix. The in-house breed of Orange Crush and Thin Mint Cookies, Mandarin Mint sounds as refreshing as the way it smokes. A potent indica-leaning hybrid, both of its parents are award winners. At 24 to 27 percent THC, Mandarin Mint is recommended for those with chronic pain, loss of appetite and anxiety. It will also relieve those holiday party hangovers and put you out for the night for much needed R&R. The first thing that you will notice is its frosty appearance (like the snowman himself!), with crystal covered flowers and dense pods filled with bursts of violet and orange. The next powerful characteristic is the smell: think along the lines of a pungent cheese platter with candied nuts. These are all the things you will fall in love with even before you smoke its smoothness. Make sure whoever you gift this to likes to share.

              <h4 class="headline custom-headline mt-4 mb-2">Evergreen Organix Cookies, The+Source </h4>
              <p class="subheading">
                Evergreen Organix has introduced their holiday-inspired line of cookies including their cookie of the month, pumpkin pecan toffee (9.65 THC/2.64 CBG). With a texture that is gooey and crumbly, these soft, fresh, baked cannabis-infused cookies are individually packaged and make a great gift for the edible lover on your gifting list. Other flavors from Evergreen carried by The+Source include snickerdoodle, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookie, and, of course, brownies. A great present to both give and receive, they are low in dosage and work for just about everyone, including newbies. To control potency while at the same time sharing the love, Evergreen’s cookies can also be cut into fractions. Evergreen lists the strain they use so it is never a “take a bite and wait and see” process—indica, sativa or hybrid effects are guaranteed.
