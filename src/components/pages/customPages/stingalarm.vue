          <p>With <a href="http://www.stingsystems.com.">Sting Alarm's</a> extensive expertise in the world of casino security systems, it isn't much of a stretch that the Las Vegas-based security company would possess the necessary qualifications to service Nevada's various medical marijuana establishments as they prepare to open their doors over the next several months.</p>

<p>Similar to gaming, the medicinal cannabis industry will be heavily regulated. "Much like gaming regulations, the state of Nevada requires that security systems are installed by a licensed security company like Sting," explained Gabe Sbarglia, a systems engineer at Sting Alarm who has diligently followed the cannabis industry for the last year-and-a-half. "We have studied the law and are fully versed in state, city and county regulations -- making sure that our clients not only meet those regulations, but, at times, exceed them."</p>

<p>[quote]Under Nevada state law, NRS 453, medicinal marijuana establishments (MMEs) are required to utilize strict security measures in order to safeguard their facilities.[/quote] "They are expected to track their products from seed to sale, and our systems are meant to aid in that process," explained Mark Weldon, another of Sting's experts in the field of MME security who, like Sbarglia, is familiar with the regulations set forth by the city of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Clark County, Nye County, the city of Mesquite and beyond.</p>

<p>In order for MMEs to safeguard their product properly, Sting has implemented the following in all of the MMEs they have designed and installed security systems for over the last several months. "We've been implementing <a href="http://www.stingalarm.com/sting-alarm-surveillance-systems.html">network based high-definition cameras</a>, electronic access control which gives the client the ability to track who is entering controlled areas, and <a href="http://www.stingalarm.com/sting-alarm-business-security.html">burglar alarms</a> with our video verification feature," said Sbarglia. "Beyond those which meet state regulations, we also recommend video analytics which allows us to install a camera that can detect movement and generate an alert even when a guard may not be looking at that particular screen."</p>

<p>"We are strongly recommending MMEs install video verification systems because it allows us to tie the camera system to the alarm system and when the alarm goes off we can see the facility immediately and dispatch local authorities right away. The goal is to provide them with an accurate description of what is going on," further explained Weldon.</p>

<p>Other recommendations Weldon and Sbarglia suggest MMEs consider are outfitting transportation vehicles with surveillance for when they are moving product and the utilization of auditing tools for their facility so they can zero in on missing product.</p>

<p>"Our methods are very stringent because we want to prevent diversion of product to people who shouldn't have it like kids, criminals, and unlicensed patients," concluded Weldon. "Safeguarding product is critical to these establishments and we are here to help prevent product from actually hitting the streets and getting in the wrong hands."</p>
